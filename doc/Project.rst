Lessons learned
---------------

This is what the developers of UrPas (Ivo Valchev and Borislav Rusinov) learned from this project:

- How to use databases in a computer program
- How to store easily data in databases and iterate through it
- How to plan carefully the plan for the month, including keeping in mind the final goal we had
- How to separate equally the work, so we could both learn as much as possible, but in the same time no one of us did the same thing (it's a team project after all)
